	_statusCodes[103] = StatusCode(103, "Early Hints", "This status code is primarily intended to be used with the Link header, letting the user agent start preloading resources while the server prepares a response or preconnect to an origin from which the page will need resources.");

It is non-committal, meaning that there is no way for the HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of the request. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.");
	_statusCodes[203] = StatusCode(203, "Non-Authoritative Information", "This response code means the returned meta-information is not exactly the same as is available from the origin server, but is collected from a local or a third-party copy. This is mostly used for mirrors of resources where the mirror's data is not exactly the same as that of the origin server, as is often the case for Web proxies.");
	_statusCodes[204] = StatusCode(204, "No Content", "There is no content to send for this request, but the headers are useful. The user agent may update its cached headers for this resource with the new ones.");

	_statusCodes[300] = StatusCode(300, "Multiple Choices", "In agent-driven content negotiation, the request has more than one possible response and the user agent or user should choose one of them. There is no standardized way for clients to automatically choose one of the responses, so this is rarely used.");

This has the same semantics as the 302 Found response code, with the exception that the user agent must not change the HTTP method used: if a POST was used in the first request, a POST must be used in the redirected request.");

This has the same semantics as the 301 Moved Permanently HTTP response code, with the exception that the user agent must not change the HTTP method used: if a POST was used in the first request, a POST must be used in the second request.");

	_statusCodes[403] = StatusCode(403, "Forbidden", "The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike 401 Unauthorized, the client's identity is known to the server.");
	_statusCodes[404] = StatusCode(404, "Not Found", "The server cannot find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized.");
	_statusCodes[405] = StatusCode(405, "Method Not Allowed", "The request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource. For example, an API may not allow DELETE on a resource, or the TRACE method entirely.");
	_statusCodes[406] = StatusCode(406, "Not Acceptable", "This response is sent when the web server, after performing server-driven content negotiation, doesn't find any content that conforms to the criteria given by the user agent.");
	_statusCodes[407] = StatusCode(407, "Proxy Authentication Required", "This is similar to 401 Unauthorized but authentication is needed to be done by a proxy.");
	_statusCodes[408] = StatusCode(408, "Request Timeout", "This response is sent on an idle connection by some servers, even without any previous request by the client. It means that the server would like to shut down this unused connection. This response is used much more since some browsers use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms to speed up browsing. Some servers may shut down a connection without sending this message.");
	_statusCodes[409] = StatusCode(409, "Conflict", "This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server. In WebDAV remote web authoring, 409 responses are errors sent to the client so that a user might be able to resolve a conflict and resubmit the request.");
	_statusCodes[410] = StatusCode(410, "Gone", "This response is sent when the requested content has been permanently deleted from server, with no forwarding address. Clients are expected to remove their caches and links to the resource. The HTTP specification intends this status code to be used for \"limited-time, promotional services\". APIs should not feel compelled to indicate resources that have been deleted with this status code.");

	_statusCodes[414] = StatusCode(414, "URI Too Long", "The URI requested by the client is longer than the server is willing to interpret.");
	_statusCodes[415] = StatusCode(415, "Unsupported Media Type", "The media format of the requested data is not supported by the server, so the server is rejecting the request.");
	_statusCodes[416] = StatusCode(416, "Range Not Satisfiable", "The ranges specified by the Range header field in the request cannot be fulfilled. It's possible that the range is outside the size of the target resource's data.");

The server sends an Upgrade header in a 426 response to indicate the required protocol(s).");
	// 427 Unassigned
	_statusCodes[428] = StatusCode(428, "Precondition Required", "The origin server requires the request to be conditional. This response is intended to prevent the 'lost update' problem, where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict.");

Note that together with this response, a user-friendly page explaining the problem should be sent. This response should be used for temporary conditions and the Retry-After HTTP header should, if possible, contain the estimated time before the recovery of the service. The webmaster must also take care about the caching-related headers that are sent along with this response, as these temporary condition responses should usually not be cached.");
